### Small Data Science Projects
Repository for small projects -- includes data wrangling in pandas, data visualization, classification models, regression models, and time series analysis.
Mostly from the first weeks of the SPICED Data Science Program.

#### 1. Gapminder & Matplotlib
Project to test out matplotlib's capabilities. Even while only using 
matplotlib you can create beautiful animated charts. Based on the gapminder
project.

#### 2. Titanic & Random Forest
A short look at a classic classification problem. Excessive feature engineering 
combined with a random forest model that is fine tuned with the help of 
GridSearchCV to push the kaggle score above 80%. 
Go [here](https://github.com/senzelden/projects/tree/master/titanic/titanic)

#### 3. Bikeshare & Regression Models
Trying out different regression models on the bikeshare dataset on kaggle.
Random Forest Regressor in combination with Gradient Boosting Regressor
gives the lowest Root Mean Squared Log Error.

#### 4. Lyrics Classifier & Lyrik Classifier
Double project about english lyrics (from Indie Rock Bands) and german poetry
(from lyrikline.org). Web Scraping is done with BeautifulSoup. Spacy is used as
a Tokenizer and Lemmatizer. Texts are sent through a TFIDF-Vectorizer.
A Naive Bayes model is used to predict artists/poets.
Go [lyrics](https://github.com/senzelden/projects/tree/master/lyrics_classifier/lyrics_classifier) or [lyrik](https://github.com/senzelden/projects/tree/master/lyrics_classifier/lyrik_classifier)

#### 5. Berlin Temperature Forecast
Time series project to predict future temperature for Berlin Tempelhof using
AR and ARIMA models with a Walk Forward approach.
Go [here](https://github.com/senzelden/projects/tree/master/time_series/temperature_forecast)
