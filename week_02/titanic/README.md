# Project: Titanic Model

![RandomForest - 100 Trees for Titanic dataset](full_tree.jpg)

### Background

As part of Kaggle's introduction to machine learning, the titanic dataset has become the 'baby dataset' for aspiring data scientists. Without any real world use case (the Titanic has sunk long ago) the dataset provides a foundation to easily test out feature engineering and classification models.

### Goal

The goal of this project is to create a complete machine learning workflow with basic EDA, feature engineering, modeling and model evaluation. A secondary goal is to score highly on the Kaggle leaderboard, though the provided notebook doesn't achieve the 100% accuracy of the top submissions on Kaggle ;).

### Sources

train.csv and test.csv are provided by Kaggle.

### Notebooks

Run titanic_full_workflow.ipynb to test out. Feature engineering is provided, but can be changed above the feature_engineering function. Just add or remove column names.
