# Project: Gapminder Scatterplot

![Scatterplot Animation Gapminder 1960-2100](output_gm.gif)

### Background

Hans Rosling (â€  2017), co-founder and former chairman of the *Gapminder Foundation* (https://www.gapminder.org/), held at TED2006 (February 2006 in Monterey, CA) a famous talk on global development.

In his talk he showed a scatterplot animation, that correlates life expectancy and fertility rate.

### Goal

The goal of this project is to reproduce this animation with the help of pandas and matplotlib. The project is part of the SPICED Data Science program.

### Sources

All data is publicly available as CSV or Excel files ((https://www.gapminder.org/data). All tables include data and predictions from 1800 through 2100, with the predictions being rather optimistic, as can be seen in the final animation.

### Notebooks

Run gapminder_scatterplot_with_newest_data.ipynb for newest version.
